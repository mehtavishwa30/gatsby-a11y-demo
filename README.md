  A11Y in React Demo 
</h1>

This is a simple demo app built with Gatsby to understand how to adopt and include important a11y practices in React. To participate in my Twitter poll to vote for an extended version of this short workshop, let me know your thoughts here: []().

## ðŸš€ Setting up this project locally

1. **Clone this repo**

2. **Run the app in development mode**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory, install dependencies, and start it up!

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-a11y-demo
    yarn install
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`! Get your hands dirty and have fun! 

## ðŸ”Ž What's inside?

A quick run-through of the files and directories you will find in this app.

    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
    â”œâ”€â”€ .prettierrc
    â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-browser.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-config.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-node.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-ssr.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
    â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ README.md

## ðŸ’» Exercise!

Your turn! Once you set up this project on your device locally, switch to the `a11y-fixes` branch and test out the changes by running the app. Compare it with the inaccessible version in the `master` branch and see how the new changes improve the a11y of our app.  

In order to switch branches and run the app, run the following commands:

- `git checkout a11y-fixes`
- `gatsby develop`

Awesome! I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you observed. DMs open [@vishwamehta30]().
